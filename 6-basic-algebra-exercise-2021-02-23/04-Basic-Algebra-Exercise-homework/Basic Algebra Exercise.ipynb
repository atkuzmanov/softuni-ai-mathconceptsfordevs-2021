    "### Problem 1. Polynomial Interpolation\n",
    "We know that if we have a set of $n$ data points with coordinates $(x_1; y_1), (x_2; y_2), \\dots, (x_n; y_n)$, we can try to figure out what function may have generated these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that **our assumptions about the data** will lead us to choosing one function over another. This means that our results are as good as our data and assumptions. Therefore, it's extremely important that we write down our assumptions (which sometimes can be difficult as we sometimes don't realize we're making them). It will be better for our readers if they know what those assumptions and models are.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we'll state two assumptions:\n",
    "1. The points in our dataset are generated by a polynomial function\n",
    "2. The points are very precise, there is absolutely no error in them. This means that the function should pass **through every point**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is called *polynomial interpolation* (*\"polynomial\"* captures assumption 1 and *\"interpolation\"* captures assumption 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be proved (look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation) for example) that if we have $n$ data points, there is only one polynomial of degree $n-1$ which passes through them. In \"math speak\": \"the vector spaces of $n$ points and polynomials of degree $n-1$ are isomorphic (there exists a bijection mapping one to the other)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of ways to do interpolation. We can also write the function ourselves if we want but this requires quite a lot more knowledge than we already covered in this course. So we'll use a function which does this for us. `numpy.polyfit()` is one such function. It accepts three main parameters (there are others as well, but they are optional): a list of $x$ coordinates, a list of $y$ coordinates, and a polynomial degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have these points:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "points = np.array([(0, 0), (1, 0.8), (2, 0.9), (3, 0.1), (4, -0.8), (5, -1.0)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to \"extract\" the coordinates:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = points[:, 0]\n",
    "y = points[:, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we need to calculate the interpolating polynomial. For the degree, we'll set $n-1$:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "coefficients = np.polyfit(x, y, len(points) - 1)\n",
    "poly = np.poly1d(coefficients)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we need to plot the function. To do this, we'll create a range of $x$ values and evaluate the polynomial at each value:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plot_x = np.linspace(np.min(x), np.max(x), 1000)\n",
    "plot_y = poly(plot_x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to plot the result. We'll plot both the fitting polynomial curve (using `plt.plot()`) and the points (using `plt.scatter`). It's also nice to have different colors to make the line stand out from the points.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.plot(plot_x, plot_y, c = \"green\")\n",
    "plt.scatter(x, y)\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"x\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"y\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Don't forget to label the axes!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task now is to **wrap the code in a function**. It should accept a list of points, the polynomial degree, min and max value of $x$ used for plotting. **Be extremely careful to ensure that the function uses its parameters!**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use this function to try some other cases."

    "We saw that a complex number $z = a + bi$ is equivalent to (and therefore can be represented as) the ordered tuple $(a; b)$, which can be plotted in a 2D space. So, complex numbers and 2D points are equivalent. What is more, we can draw a vector from the origin of the coordinate plane to our point. This is called a point's **radius-vector**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try plotting complex numbers as radius vectors. Don't forget to label the real and imaginary axes. Also, move the axes to the origin. Hint: These are called \"spines\"; you'll need to move 2 of them to the origin and remove the other 2 completely. Hint 2: You already did this in the previous lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `plt.quiver()` to plot the vector. It can behave a bit strangely, so we'll need to set the scale of the vectors to be the same as the scale on the graph axes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.quiver(0, 0, z.real, z.imag, angles = \"xy\", scale_units = \"xy\", scale = 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than that, the main parameters are: $x_{begin}$, $y_{begin}$, $x_{length}$, $y_{length}$ in that order.\n",

It's a good practice not to jam the plot too much, so leave a little bit of space. That is, if the actual x-range is $[-2; 2]$, set the plotting to be $[-2.5; 2.5]$ for example. Otherwise, the vector heads (arrows) will be \"jammed\" into a corner or side of the plot."

    "\n",
    "Let's do one of the most famous recursion examples. And I'm not talking about Fibonacci here. Let's draw a tree using recursive functions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"broccoli.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 300px\" />\n",

    "There's one more important part of recursion, and this is **\"the clean-up\"**. After we did something in the recursive calls, it's very important to return the state of everything as it was **before** we did anything.
